## 🔴 P0-1: One-liner (50 characters)

### 当前问题
```
❌ "Lets AI safely execute real on-chain actions"
   问题：普通人不懂 "on-chain"
   
❌ "Agentic AI Web3 browser with OS-level automation"
   问题：全是 buzzwords
```

### 修改方案

**方案 A（最直白）：**
```
Browser where AI can click and sign without breaking stuff
```
(55 chars - 稍微超了，但清楚)

**方案 B（更短）：**
```
AI browser that won't drain your wallet
```
(39 chars ✅)

**方案 C（强调安全）：**
```
See what AI will do before it does it
```
(38 chars ✅)

**方案 D（行动导向）：**
```
Let AI use your browser safely
```
(30 chars ✅)

### 推荐：方案 B 或 C

---

## 🔴 P0-2: "What do you make?"

### 当前问题
太长、太多 buzzword、太抽象

### 修改后版本

```
We make a browser where AI can actually do things—fill forms, 
click buttons, sign transactions—without screwing up.

The problem: if you let AI control your browser today, it might 
accidentally approve something that drains your wallet. There's 
no way to preview what's about to happen.

Our browser shows you exactly what AI is about to do before 
anything runs. You see which buttons it will click, what it 
will sign, what changes. Then you approve, and it executes.

We're starting with crypto users because their mistakes cost 
real money—one wrong signature and your funds are gone forever. 
They'll pay for safety.

The tech is general. If we nail this for crypto, we can expand 
to anywhere AI needs to act in the real world.
```

### 要点
- ✅ 第一句就说清楚做什么
- ✅ 问题具体、有画面感
- ✅ 解决方案简单明了
- ✅ 诚实说初始市场是 crypto
- ✅ 解释为什么选这个市场
- ✅ 展示扩展路径

## 🔴 P0-4: Founder Video 脚本

### 格式要求
- 60-90 秒
- 所有 4 位创始人出镜
- 不要念稿，但要有结构
- 不要花哨剪辑

### 脚本大纲

```
[0-10秒] 介绍
"Hi, we're NogicOS. I'm [Tielong], CEO. This is [Yifeng] our CTO, 
[Hang Song] COO, and [ZinoTang] CBO."

[10-30秒] 做什么 + 问题
"We're building a browser where AI can actually do things safely.

Right now, if you let AI control your browser, it might click the 
wrong button or sign something that drains your wallet. There's no 
way to know what's about to happen."

[30-50秒] 解决方案
"Our browser shows you exactly what AI will do before it runs. 
You see which buttons it clicks, what it signs, what changes. 
Then you approve. We're starting with crypto because those 
mistakes cost real money."

[50-70秒] 为什么是我们
"[Yifeng] built HuggingFace—he knows how to make AI work in production.
[Hang Song] raised from a16z and did a $500M deal.
[ZinoTang] exited to Tencent at 25.
[Tielong] scaled Boom.AI to 5M users.
We've all shipped products to millions. Now we're building together."

[70-90秒] 进度 + ask
"We're [current status]. We'd love YC's help to [specific ask—
move faster / get early users / make connections]."
```

### 录制 Tips
- 找一个安静、光线好的地方
- 不要站成一排，稍微有点层次
- 说话自然，像跟朋友聊天
- 不要超过 90 秒

---

## 🟠 P1-1: Landing Page

### 目的
1. 证明你们在认真做这件事
2. 收集 waitlist 作为 traction
3. 给 YC 一个可以访问的 URL

### 最简方案 (3天内)

**工具选择：**
- Carrd ($19/年) - 最快
- Framer - 更好看
- Webflow - 功能多但复杂

**页面内容：**
```
[Hero]
NogicOS
AI browser that won't drain your wallet
See what AI will do before it does it.
[Join Waitlist] 按钮

[Problem]
AI can plan, but it can't act safely.
Let it control your browser today, and it might sign 
something that empties your wallet.

[Solution]
We show you exactly what's about to happen.
- Preview every click
- See every signature
- Approve, then execute

[Team]
4 photos + one-line bios
HuggingFace · a16z · Tencent · Forbes 30U30

[Waitlist]
Be first to try NogicOS
[Email input] [Join]
```

### Waitlist 工具
- Tally (免费)
- Typeform
- 直接用 Carrd 内置的

---

## 🟠 P1-2: Demo Video (60秒)

### 目的
展示产品概念，即使没有真实产品

### 方案 A：Figma 原型演示
```
用 Figma 做一个可点击的原型，录屏演示：
1. 打开浏览器
2. AI 说 "我要帮你 swap 100 USDC to ETH"
3. 弹出预览面板，显示会发生什么
4. 用户点 Approve
5. 执行完成
```

### 方案 B：概念视频
```
用简单的动画/图示解释：
1. 问题：AI 控制浏览器的风险
2. 解决方案：预览 → 批准 → 执行
3. 为什么这很重要
```

### 方案 C：真实 POC 演示
```
如果 CTO 能快速搭一个最简 POC：
- 一个浏览器窗口
- AI 输入一个指令
- 显示预览结果
- 不需要真的执行
```

### 推荐：方案 A（Figma）最快，2-3天可完成

## 🟠 P1-3: Waitlist 增长策略

approve a transaction that drains your funds.

Our fix: see exactly what AI will do before it runs.

## 🟡 P2: Mock Interview 准备

### 必答问题 + 答案

**Q: What are you making?**
```
A browser where AI can actually do things—click, fill forms, sign 
transactions—without screwing up. We show you what's about to happen 
before it runs, you approve, then it executes.
```

**Q: Who are your users?**
```
Crypto power users. People who do 10-50 transactions a day. Traders, 
DeFi users, NFT collectors. They lose money to phishing and bad 
approvals. They'll pay for a browser that stops that.
```

**Q: Why you?**
```
Our CTO built HuggingFace—he knows how to make AI work in production. 
Our COO raised from a16z and did a $500M deal. Our CBO exited to 
Tencent at 25. We've all shipped to millions. Now we're building together.
```

**Q: Why crypto?**
```
Crypto is where mistakes are most expensive—transactions can't be undone. 
If we nail safety here, we can expand to anywhere AI needs to act. 
The tech is general.
```

**Q: How do you make money?**
```
Pro subscription—$15-25/month for power users who want AI execution, 
previews, and safety features. Like Perplexity Pro but for doing things, 
not just searching.
```

**Q: What have you built so far?**
```
[需要有东西可说！]
- Landing page with X signups
- Figma prototype / POC
- Demo video
```
