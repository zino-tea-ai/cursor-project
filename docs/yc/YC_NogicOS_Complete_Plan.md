## 🔴 第一优先级：申请内容修改 (本周完成)

### 1. One-liner (50 characters)

**最终推荐：**
```
See what AI will do before it does it
```
(38 chars)

**备选：**
```
Browser where AI actually does things safely
```
(44 chars)

**为什么这个最好：**
- ✅ 普通人秒懂
- ✅ 没有 buzzword
- ✅ 没有 crypto/web3
- ✅ 暗示核心价值：预览 → 安全

---

### 2. "What do you make?" (完整版本)

```
We make a browser where AI can actually do things—click buttons, 
fill forms, sign transactions—without screwing up.

The problem: if you let AI control your browser today, it might 
accidentally approve something that drains your wallet. There's 
no way to see what's about to happen before it runs.

Our solution: we show you exactly what AI will do before anything 
executes. You see which buttons it clicks, what forms it fills, 
what it signs, what changes. You approve, then it runs.

We're starting with crypto users because their mistakes cost real 
money—one wrong signature and funds are gone forever. They already 
pay $15-25/month for security tools. We're the browser that stops 
the mistakes before they happen.

The tech is general. Simulation, preview, approval—this works 
anywhere AI needs to act safely.
```

Hang Song COO, and ZinoTang CBO."

your browser today, and it might click the wrong button or approve 
something that drains your wallet."

[25-40秒] 解决方案
"Our browser shows you exactly what AI will do before it runs. 
You see what it clicks, what it signs, what changes. Then you 
approve. Starting with crypto because those mistakes cost real money."

[40-55秒] 为什么是我们
"Yifeng built HuggingFace—2 million AI models run on it.
Hang Song did a 500 million dollar deal and raised from a16z.
Zino exited to Tencent at 25, Forbes 30 Under 30.
I scaled Boom.AI to 5 million users.
We've all shipped to millions. Now we're building together in SF."

[55-60秒] Ask

## 🟡 第三优先级：面试准备 (提交后)

### 必答问题 + 标准答案

**Q: What are you making?**
```
A browser where AI can actually do things—click, fill, sign—without 
screwing up. We show you what's about to happen before it runs. 
You approve, then it executes.
```

**Q: Who needs this?**
```
Crypto power users. They do 10-50 transactions a day. One wrong 
approval can drain their wallet. They already pay for security 
tools. We stop mistakes before they happen.
```

**Q: Why you?**
```
Yifeng built HuggingFace—he knows AI in production. 
Hang Song raised from a16z and did a $500M deal.
Zino exited to Tencent at 25. 
I scaled an app to 5M users.
We've shipped to millions. Now we're building together.
```

**Q: Why crypto first?**
```
Mistakes are most expensive—transactions can't be undone. 
If we nail safety here, we expand anywhere AI needs to act.
```

**Q: Why now?**
```
AI can finally plan complex tasks—but there's no safe way to 
execute them. Claude, GPT can tell you what to do; they can't 
safely do it for you. We're the execution layer.
```

**Q: Competitors?**
```
Chrome and Safari don't have AI execution built in.
Perplexity and ChatGPT can plan but can't safely act.
Wallets protect keys but not execution.
We're the only one connecting AI planning to safe execution.
```

**Q: How do you make money?**
```
Pro subscription, $15-25/month. Power users who want AI execution 
with previews and safety. Like Perplexity Pro but for doing, 
not just searching.
```
